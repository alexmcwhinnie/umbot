# This file should list any files or directories you want included with the
# T2 bundling and deployment process. This is handy for including
# non-JavaScript assets, like HTML, CSS, and images, for use within your project.
# .tesselinclude works the same as .npminclude
# You DO NOT need to list node_modules or package.json
# For more information, visit: https://tessel.io/docs/cli#usage
